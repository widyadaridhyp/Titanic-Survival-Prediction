# Titanic-Survival-Prediction

## Background
> RMS Titanic was a British ocean liner that sank in the early hours of 15 April 1912 as a result of striking an iceberg on her maiden voyage from Southampton, England, to New York City, United States. Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, approximately 1,500 died (figures vary), making the incident one of the deadliest peacetime sinkings of a single ship. Titanic, operated by White Star Line, carried some of the wealthiest people in the world, as well as hundreds of emigrants from the British Isles, Scandinavia, and elsewhere in Europe who were seeking a new life in the United States and Canada. The disaster drew public attention, spurred major changes in maritime safety regulations, and inspired a lasting legacy in popular culture.

##Problem Statement
> Misidentifying potential survivors can lead to misallocation of limited rescue resources, putting lives at risk.

## Urgency
> As time is very limited with the risk of hypothermia in a short period of time in extremely cold seas, and due to limited lifeboats, the selection decision of who to rescue must be made quickly and correctly.

## Metrics
> Precision

## Recommendation
> The 'Ladies and Children First' scheme worked â€” survival rates were significantly higher for women and children. However, to enhance precision and avoid misclassification in life-or-death decisions, a tiered, data-driven rescue plan is crucial.
> Priority Tiers: Children (Toodler - Teenager) with their parents > Female > Doctor > Seniors with a companion
> Provide special evacuation routes and assistive devices for those in need including the senior
> Prioritize medical and expert personnel to treat surviving passangers. There should be at least 1 doctor/medic on the lifeboat
